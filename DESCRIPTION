Description: Plot an 'R' package's recursive dependency graph and tabulate the 
    number of unique downstream dependencies added by top-level dependencies. 
    This helps 'R' package developers identify which of their declared 
    dependencies add the most downstream dependencies in order to prioritize
    them for removal if needed. Uses graph stress minimization adapted from 
    Schoch (2023) <doi:10.21105/joss.05238> and originally reported in Gansner 
    et al. (2004) <doi:10.1007/978-3-540-31843-9_25>.
